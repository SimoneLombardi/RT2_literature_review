Hybrydnet is a new approach to task scheduling for human-robot teams
The paper states it is better in every metric with respect to state of the art approach:

	1) makespan	--> total time to complete all task (minimize)
	2) feasibility	--> % of feasible schedule	     (maximize)  
	3) time	--> run time statistic		     (minimize)
	
This algorithm was pitted agains EDF, Genetic Algorithm, HetGat scheduler.
Also the strenght of this implementation is that it does not neet to query the environment multiple times(reducing the time needed to complete the schedule).

HOW IT WORKS
-- step one --
	HetGAT layer (Heterogeneous Graph Encoder)
	this elements is used to condense all the environment information for the scheduler to use, from temporal constraint, task information, agent capabilities.
	Is used to avoid the necessity to periodically control the environment information in the scheduling part
	
-- step two --
	Scheduling (Recurrent Schedule Propagator)
	this element is used to create the schedule. It uses a LSTM(long short term memory) paradigm to save the state at every step of the scheduling process.
	The scheduler select a couple of <task - agent> that it thinks is suitable, updates the internal state and propagate the effect of the choice.
	
(all of this works because math)

PROS
1) does not need to periodically query the environment for information -> is faster than the competitor
2) is more ligth weigth than other implementation, in the scheduler part
3) can deal with the stochastic nature of the human agent, without forcing a deterministic nature in it

HiTAB or Hierarchical Training of Agent Behaviour is a new approach at coordinating groups of heterogeneus robots.
The objective of the paper is to create a functional robot group that is "trainable" rather than "coding" the behaviour, this approach is of course interesting for application were expert are scarse and
cannot easly reach a customer to code a specific behaviour in the robot.

problem:
	1) the possible high dimensional space in wich the paper is moving. Setting aside numerosity of the agent, we have a robot that can have complex internal action and sensor and on top of that 
	the communication needed to create the collaboration between the robot
	2) the absence of an inverse function that given the goal is capable of makeing the robot accomplish said goal
	
solution:
	manual goal decomposition, by haveing a user create a set of sub goal that lead to the final one the robot can be taugth the specific behaviour to accomplish the final goal
	(reducing the size of the learning space)
	// --> the initial behaviour library consisit in basic HARD coded beaviour, created by the manufacturer of the robot
	
	
	The training with the HiTAB paradigm works as follows:
	1) Training mode
		In this phase the Agent(robot) performs the action as shown by the demostrator(human), the Agent create a "sample" that is stored as a FINITE STATE MACHINE state.
		this sample are than passed to a classification algorithm before being saved
	
	2) Testing mode
		When enough sample have been saved the demonstrator can trigger the Testing mode, in this state the robot create the TRANSITION between the STATE sample collected in the Training mode
		And than the Agent performs the learned behaviour. If the demonstrator is not happy with the result the process can be repeated
