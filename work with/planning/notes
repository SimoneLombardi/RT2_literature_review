Coordination of Groups of Heterogeneous Robots using Temporal Planning
Temporal Planning Strategy
Temporal planning has emerged as a crucial strategy in coordinating heterogeneous robot teams, particularly in scenarios demanding dynamic and resource-efficient operations. The essence of temporal planning lies in generating plans that account for individual robot capabilities, spatial distribution, and task requirements while efficiently managing the high-dimensionality of the state space. Two pivotal studies that explore this strategy in depth are "Adaptive Heterogeneous Multi-Robot Collaboration from Formal Task Specifications" and "Task Allocation Strategy for Heterogeneous Robot Teams in Offshore Missions."
Adaptive Heterogeneous Multi-Robot Collaboration from Formal Task Specifications
This study focuses on utilizing formal task specifications to adaptively coordinate heterogeneous robot teams. The primary contributions include:
1.	Formal Task Specification and Decomposition:
o	Tasks are specified formally using a high-level description language, allowing for precise task definitions.
o	The specified tasks are decomposed into smaller sub-tasks based on the capabilities of different robots. For example, an inspection task might be divided into movement, data collection, and data analysis sub-tasks, each allocated to robots best suited for these functions.
2.	Temporal Constraints Management:
o	The temporal planner ensures synchronization of actions across multiple robots. For instance, if one robot needs to hold a valve open while another performs an inspection, the planner schedules these actions to occur concurrently.
o	The planner dynamically adjusts task schedules in response to real-time changes in the environment or robot status, ensuring that mission objectives are met even under unpredictable conditions.
3.	Dynamic Adaptation:
o	The system continuously monitors robot performance and environmental conditions, re-allocating tasks and re-planning as necessary. For example, if a robot encounters an obstacle, the planner re-routes other robots or assigns backup tasks to ensure mission continuity.
Enhancement with Multi-Role Goal Assignment (MRGA)
Carreno et al. (2020) propose a novel task allocation strategy called Multi-Role Goal Assignment (MRGA), which enhances the efficiency and quality of plans generated by temporal planners. MRGA builds on the foundational work of formal task specifications by introducing several key enhancements:
1.	Multi-Role Goal Assignment (MRGA):
o	MRGA allocates mission goals by considering robot capabilities, sensor redundancy, spatial distribution, and task implementation time. This reduces the computational burden by avoiding exhaustive enumeration of all possible task assignments.
o	For instance, in an offshore platform scenario, MRGA ensures that aerial drones handle high-altitude inspections while ground robots manage tasks requiring stability and power.
2.	Temporal Planning Integration:
o	The strategy integrates MRGA with advanced AI temporal planners like POPF and OPTIC, which support numerical fluents, concurrency, and exogenous events. This integration reduces the search space size, leading to faster and more effective planning.
o	For example, the POPF planner is used to minimize the makespan of tasks, ensuring that inspection and maintenance tasks on an oil rig are completed in the shortest possible time.
3.	Experimental Validation:
o	The effectiveness of the approach is validated through simulations involving a fleet of Husky and Quadcopter robots operating in an offshore platform environment. Metrics such as spatial goal distribution, makespan, planning time, and goal allocation rate are used to demonstrate the strategy's efficacy.
o	Experimental results show that MRGA improves plan robustness and quality, significantly reducing planning time compared to traditional methods. For instance, in a simulated oil rig scenario, MRGA achieved a 30% reduction in planning time while maintaining high plan quality and robustness.
Technical Examples and Implementation Details
•	Task Allocation:
o	In the study on formal task specifications, task allocation is managed by decomposing tasks into smaller sub-tasks and assigning them based on robot capabilities. MRGA enhances this by evaluating the capabilities, sensor redundancies, and spatial distributions of the robots. For example, inspection tasks requiring high precision are allocated to robots equipped with advanced sensors, while transport tasks are given to robots with higher load capacity. This ensures that each task is matched with the most suitable robot, improving overall efficiency.
•	Temporal Constraints:
o	The formal specification approach handles temporal constraints by scheduling tasks to ensure minimal conflict and maximum efficiency. MRGA adds to this by integrating these constraints into its goal assignment algorithm. It optimizes the scheduling of tasks by considering the temporal dependencies and resource limitations, ensuring that tasks are distributed in a way that respects these constraints. For example, MRGA ensures that tasks requiring concurrent execution are planned accordingly, such as synchronizing a drone's aerial survey with a ground robot's data collection.
•	Adaptation to Dynamic Environments:
o	The formal specification approach continuously adapts to changes by re-evaluating task assignments and updating plans in real-time. MRGA complements this by dynamically adjusting task allocations based on real-time feedback from the robots and the environment. This ensures that the mission objectives are met even in the face of unexpected changes. For example, if an aerial drone detects an obstacle that a ground robot must navigate around, MRGA quickly reallocates tasks to ensure mission continuity without significant delays.
•	Scalability and Robustness:
o	The formal specification approach is designed to scale with the number of robots and complexity of tasks through modular task decomposition. MRGA enhances scalability by reducing computational complexity through efficient task distribution algorithms. Both methods ensure robust performance in large-scale and complex environments, such as offshore platforms. By leveraging the strengths of temporal planning and advanced task allocation strategies, MRGA ensures that the system can handle an increasing number of robots and more complex tasks without a significant increase in planning time or computational load.
Conclusion
The integration of formal task specifications and Multi-Role Goal Assignment with temporal planning provides a powerful framework for coordinating heterogeneous robot teams. These approaches address the challenges of dynamic, resource-constrained environments by optimizing task allocation, managing temporal constraints, and adapting to real-time changes. Together, they represent a significant advancement in the field, enabling efficient and robust multi-robot coordination in various applications, from industrial inspection to autonomous exploration.
